# PayDay Bank
The app is tes project demonstating my vision of banking client.
It contains next features:
+SignIn with fingerprint auth from android 6.0. User's password stores in the most security place - AndroidKeystore system with AES encryption. (Note: authenticate API not working, so the application return stub account data)
+Fetching and displaying all transaction categories by given account with sorting by date's range.
+Displaying transactions by given category

Project uses next libraries/technologies: Kotlin, Okhttp, Coroutines, Retrofit, Dagger2 with Hilt, Lifecycle, LiveData, ViewModel, Moshi, Glide, JUnit, Mockito, UI navigation

### TODOS/Improvements
+ resources doesn't contains big logo
+ icon logo which is presented in resources has shape. Icon shape should be generated by android studio tools.
+ smooth screen transaction/animations
+ displaying such errors as no network connection/servers offline
+ Showing data loading progress
+ caching data in rooms database
+ Create java docs
+ Make viewmodel unit tests/ ui tests
+ Using diffutils inside adapters instead of 'notifyDataSetChanged()'
+ make ui constraints, e.g. hanling long texts, different screen sizes
+ handle application state restoration


### Technical questions
1) How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't
spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

usually 20% of amoun time. I would test all components separately, e.g. repository with mocking data providers, usecases, viewmodels - interaction with ui

2) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a
snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

Currently the newest feature of kotlin is coroutines flow that can be uses instead of RxJava and has tie integration with ui lifecycle
 private var categories: Collection<Category> = listOf()
    private val click = BroadcastChannel<View>(1)
    val clickFlow = click.asFlow().mapLatest { Pair(it,
        categories.elementAt((it.parent as RecyclerView).getChildAdapterPosition(it))) }.catch {  }

3) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
The golden rule of mobile development performance is to move operation out of ui threads and using parralel executions. To track performance I use measureTimeInMillis from kotlin.

4) How would you debug issues related to API usage? Can you give us an example?
To test application behaviour we need to create repository tests with mocking network data provider


5) How would you improve the Node serverâ€™s API that you just used?
+ User json should not contains password but token
+ List of transactions should contains only related to current account id
+ Dates should be represented as Long timestamp variable
+ Amounts should be represented as Float variable
there are can be some structures improvements, e.g. sorting transactions by dates on server side when placing in database.
